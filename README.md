# Hypixel User Lookup
Ever logged onto Hypixel and realized you were permenantly banned for no reason? Your Minecraft account may have been compromised. Use this program to check for unusual account activity.
# Installation
Just go to the Releases tab and download the .exe file. Mac and Linux builds will come (hopefully) soon. 
# Goals
 - Make an easy-to-use program without the intimidation of a command line
 - Make everything here more organized
# QnA
- Windows Smartscreen questions whether this file is safe.
  - Trust me, it is safe. Upload this to virustotal.com and the only AV that detects it is SecureAge APEX (which I can almost guarantee you've never heard of).
- How the heck am I supposed to get an API key if I'm banned?
  - Someone else can log onto the server, generate the key, and send it to you.
- Why do we need our own keys?
  - From what I read, Hypixel allows API requests every 0.5 seconds on the same key. If this program becomes frequently used and the same key was used over and over, the program will break.
- Why are you trying to help evade bans?
  - If you were violating the Hypixel rules, that's your fault. If someone else logged into your account and violated the rules, you can use this program to find out if someone used your account. After getting information, you can follow the official appeal process from there.
- Where is this data coming from?
  - api.hypixel.net
